# Underwater-Waste-Detection-Using-YoloV8-And-Water-Quality-Assessment
 Neural Ocean is a project that addresses the issue of growing underwater waste in oceans and seas. It offers three solutions: YoloV8 Algorithm-based underwater waste detection, a rule-based classifier for aquatic life habitat assessment, and a Machine Learning model for water classification as fit for drinking or irrigation or not fit. The first model was trained on a dataset of 5000* images, while the second model used chemical properties guidelines from US EPA and WHO. The third model was trained on a dataset with over 6 million rows, providing reliable water classification results.
